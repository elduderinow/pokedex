## THE PROJECT ITSEL & MY OPINION
I had a fun time working on this project, most of the parts were easy, where I did not need the internet or whatsoever. I did sometimes had to look back to the previous excercises because I forgot the right syntax. But what I want to do and how I want to do it, it's already in my head.

HTML and css was easy, but the part where I needed to display the previous form in javascript got me thinking.

I did managed to get it done, but with another fetch of the same API object, not as good code as I wanted to beceause of the time limit.

I however will keep improving this pokedex because I like it and there are many extra improvements to be done.

I think it's a nice assigment for learning HMTL, CSS and JS.
